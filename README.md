# AoC-2023
Repository for [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023)

- Day 1 :sparkles: :sparkles:
  - Extracting numbers from strings
- Day 2 :sparkles: :sparkles:
  - Extracting numbers from more mangled strings and processing
- Day 3 :sparkles: :sparkles:
  - Extracting numbers based on adjacent symbols.  
    This one was hard. The approach and code is disgusting and could be significantly improved.
- Day 4 :sparkles: :sparkles:
  - Recursion.  
    This could probably be done more efficiently with fewer repeated checks with a little thought.
- Day 5 :sparkles: :sparkles:
  - Calculations.  
    This one even has tests! :O Nice in comparison to yesterday.  
    Could probably have used bisection or quadratic formula if wanting to be clever.
